## Interest Savings Calculation

Amount of 'Interest Saved' is calculated as follows:

**For revolving plans:** For each month, we determine interest savings by multiplying our current revolving balances by our balance-weighted average APR minus the average interest rate on credit card plans, then dividing by 12. We then sum up the interest savings over all months since the company's launch.

**For fixed rate plans:** For each month, we determine the interest savings by multiplying our current fixed rate balances by our balance-weighted average APR minus the average interest rate for 5 year fixed personal loans, then dividing by 12. We then sum up the interest savings over all months since the company's launch.

We then sum up the cumulative savings for both revolving and fixed rate plans.
