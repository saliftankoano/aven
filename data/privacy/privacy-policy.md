Please note that if you participate in a sweepstakes, contest or giveaway through the Services, we may ask you for your Contact Information to notify you if you win or not, to verify your identity, determine your eligibility, and/or to send you prizes. In some situations, we may need additional information as a part of the entry process, such as a prize selection choice. These sweepstakes and contests are voluntary. We recommend that you read the rules and other relevant information for each sweepstakes and contest that you enter.

**Contact List Information:** With your permission, we may import your nonpublic list of personal contacts, or address book, their Contact Information, and their Identity Information.

**Third Party Data Sources:** We may combine Personal Information we receive from you with Personal Information we obtain from other sources, such as:

- Public sources, such as government agencies, public records, social media platforms, and other publicly available sources
- Data providers, such as information services and data licensors that provide demographic and other information
- Marketing partners, such as joint marketing partners and event co-sponsors

### Automatic Data Collection

We, our service providers, and our business partners may automatically log information about you, your computer or mobile device, and your interaction over time with the Services, our communications and other online services, such as:

- Device data, such as your computer or mobile device's operating system type and version, manufacturer and model, browser type, screen resolution, RAM and disk size, CPU usage, device type (e.g., phone, tablet), IP address, unique identifiers (including identifiers used for advertising purposes), language settings, mobile device carrier, radio/network information (e.g., Wi-Fi, LTE, 3G), and general location information such as city, state or general geographic area.

- Online activity data, such as pages or screens you viewed, how long you spent on a page or screen, the website you visited before browsing to the Service, navigation paths between pages or screens, information about your activity on a page or screen, access times and duration of access, and whether you have opened our emails or clicked links within them.

- Communication interaction data such as your interactions with our email or other communications (e.g., whether you open and/or forward emails) â€“ we may do this through use of pixel tags (which are also known as clear GIFs), which may be embedded invisibly in our emails.

### Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies

Some of the automatic collection described above is facilitated by cookies and similar technologies:

- **Cookies:** Small text files that websites store on user devices and that allow web servers to record users' web browsing activities and remember their submissions, preferences, and login status as they navigate a site. Cookies used on our sites include both "session cookies" that are deleted when a session ends, "persistent cookies" that remain longer, "first party" cookies that we place and "third party" cookies that our third-party business partners and service providers place.

- **Local storage technologies:** Like HTML5, that provide cookie-equivalent functionality but can store larger amounts of data on your device outside of your browser in connection with specific applications.

- **Web beacons:** Also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs, which are used to demonstrate that a webpage or email was accessed or opened, or that certain content was viewed or clicked.

### Session-replay Technologies

We use session replay technologies on the Services, such as those provided by OpenReply and/or LogRocket who employs software code to record users' interactions with the Site in a manner that allows us to watch video replays of those user sessions. The replays capture data such as users' mouse movements, page visits, network requests and responses, console logs, JavaScript exceptions, and browser performance metrics. These replays help us diagnose usability problems and identify areas for improvement.

### Sources of Personal Information

We collect Personal Information from various sources based on the context in which we process it:

**You:** We collect Personal Information from you directly, for example, when you input information into an online form, sign up for a waiting list, or contact us directly.

**Your Devices:** We may collect certain Personal Information automatically from your devices. For example, we collect Device/Network Information automatically using cookies and similar technologies when you use our Service, access our Sites, or when you open our marketing communications.

**Third-Parties:** We receive Personal Information from third parties with whom we have a relationship in connection with a relevant transaction, or who collect information on our behalf.

**Data Aggregators:** We collect Personal Information from data aggregators that maintain databases of information relating to individuals and who provide us with certain data we use to augment an individual's profile or other Personal Information we maintain.

**Advertising Networks:** We may collect certain information, such as Device/Network Information or Inference Information from advertising networks that operate on our Sites.

**Creation/Inference:** We (or third parties operating on our behalf) create and infer Personal Information (such as Inference Information) based on our observations or analysis of other Personal Information we process, and we may correlate this information with other information we process about you.

## How We Use Personal Information

### Communications

We may process Personal Information in connection with email and SMS marketing communications (such as promotional emails), which you might receive if you sign up for updates regarding our products and services, choose to receive SMS/email marketing communications, or engage in a transaction allowing us to send you email marketing communications. We may also collect Personal Information when you open or interact with email marketing communications. We may send you SMS communications by automated means.

Subject to your rights and choices, we use Personal Information as necessary to customize, deliver, and otherwise process marketing communications, and in order to tailor certain communications to individuals' preferences and requests. Additionally, we may process Personal Information from devices receiving those marketing communications as part of our business interests in understanding whether our emails are opened or other aspects of engagement with such marketing communications.

This section applies only to California residents. It describes how we collect, use, disclose and share Personal Information of California residents in operating our business, and their rights with respect to that Personal Information. For purposes of this section, "Personal Information" has the meaning given in the California Consumer Privacy Act but does not include data exempted from the scope of the CCPA.

### Your California privacy rights

As a California resident, you have the rights listed below. However, these rights are not absolute and, in certain cases, we may decline your request as permitted by law.

- **Information:** You can request information about the categories of Personal Information that we have collected; the categories of sources from which we collected Personal Information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting, sharing and/or selling Personal Information; the categories of any Personal Information that we sold or disclosed for a business purpose; and the categories of any third parties with whom Personal Information was sold, shared or disclosed for a business purpose.

- **Nondiscrimination:** You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination. This means that we will not penalize you for exercising your rights by taking actions such as denying you services; increasing the price/rate of services; decreasing service quality; or suggesting that we may penalize you as described above for exercising your rights.

### How to Exercise Your Rights

**Right to information, access, correction, and deletion:** You can request to exercise these rights by emailing us at support@aven.com.

**Right to opt-out of the "sale" or "sharing" of your Personal Information:** You can request to opt-out of the "sharing" of your Personal Information by clicking the Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information link in the footer of this webpage. Your request to opt-out will apply only to the browser and the device from which you submit the request. We do not otherwise "sell" Personal Information as defined by the CCPA.

**Identity verification:** We need to verify your identity to process your requests to exercise your rights to know, access, deletion, and correction, and we reserve the right to confirm your California residency. To verify your identity, we may require you to log into your account if you have one, provide identifiers we can match against information we may have collected from you previously, confirm your request using the email address used to make the request, provide government identification, or provide a declaration under penalty of perjury, where permitted by law.

**Authorized agents:** Your authorized agent may make a request on your behalf upon our verification of the agent's identity and our receipt of a copy of a valid power of attorney given to your authorized agent pursuant to applicable state law. If you have not provided your agent with such a power of attorney, we may ask you and/or your agent to take additional steps permitted by law to verify that your request is authorized, such as information required to verify your identity and that you have given the authorized agent permission to submit the request.

### Information practices

The following describes our practices currently and during the past 12 months:

**Sale and sharing of Personal Information:** Our use of the behavioral advertising services described above may constitute "sharing" of your Personal Information with our advertising partners from which you have the right to opt-out under the CCPA.

As stated above, we do not otherwise "sell" Personal Information as defined by the CCPA. Although our Services are not intended for children under 16 years of age, we are required to inform you that we do not have actual knowledge that we have sold or shared the Personal Information of children under 16.

**Sensitive personal information:** We do not use or disclose sensitive personal information (as that term is defined under CCPA) for purposes that California residents have a right to limit under the CCPA.

**Deidentified data:** We do not attempt to reidentify deidentified information that we derive from Personal Information except that we may do so to test whether our deidentification processes comply with applicable law.

**Retention:** Our criteria for deciding how long to retain Personal Information is generally based on whether such period is sufficient to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it as described in this Privacy Policy, including complying with our legal obligations.

**Sources and purposes:** We collect all categories of Personal Information from the sources, use them for the business purposes described in the How We Collect and Use Personal Information section above, and disclose them for the business purposes described in the How We Disclose Information section above.
