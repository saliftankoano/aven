PLEASE READ SECTIONS I and II OF THESE DISPUTE RESOLUTION TERMS CAREFULLY AND ENTIRELY. THEY CONTAIN TERMS AFFECTING HOW YOU WILL RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH US.



---


# I ARBITRATION AGREEMENT – THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT GOVERNS DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US

(A) Facts about arbitration. Arbitration is a process in which persons with a Dispute: (i) give up their rights to file a lawsuit and proceed in court and to have a jury trial to resolve their Dispute; and (ii) agree, instead, to submit their Disputes to a neutral third person (an arbitrator) for a decision. Each party to the Dispute has an opportunity to present some evidence to the arbitrator. Pre-arbitration discovery may be limited. Arbitration proceedings are private and less formal than court trials. The arbitrator will issue a final and binding decision resolving the dispute, which may be enforced as a court judgment. A court rarely overturns an arbitrator's decision.

(B) Persons covered by this Arbitration Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement covers, governs and applies to all "Disputes" between or among you and us (including any of the Company Parties and any Lender).

(C) Meaning of Dispute. For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, the term "Dispute" or "Disputes" shall have the meaning set forth in the section entitled Governing Law except as provided in this sub-paragraph (C). For purposes of this Agreement to Arbitrate, the term Dispute shall also include disputes arising out of or relating in any way whatsoever to any Aven Auto-Secured Card Cardholder Agreement and, in addition, any disputes concerning the formation, existence, validity, enforceability, revocation or scope of this Arbitration Agreement, including any disputes about the arbitrability of any claim or cause of action. All such Disputes shall be referred to the arbitrator.

Exclusions from the Meaning of Dispute for purposes of this arbitration agreement only. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of this Arbitration Agreement only, "Dispute" shall not include any claim, counterclaim, crossclaim, complaint, cross-complaint, controversy, or dispute between or among you and us (including any Company Party) that arises out of, or relates to: (i) ownership, licensing, infringement, misappropriation or cybersquatting of our patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets or Sites; (ii) any credit agreement with You secured by a mortgage or deed of trust on your principal residence including any Dispute arising out of or relating to any Home Equity Credit Card Account, Home Equity Loan, or financial product secured by a mortgage or Deed of Trust on your principal residence; or (iii) or any credit agreement entered into by You if you are a member of the United States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, or Coast Guard currently serving on active duty or You are a spouse or child of an active member of the military. If an exclusion applies then the excluded claims will be resolved in accordance with Section II, below, but only after arbitration of any arbitrable disputes between you and the Company (including any Company Party).

(D) Waiver of jury trial and participation in class action. You acknowledge and agree that by entering into this Arbitration Agreement: (i) YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE A TRIAL BY JURY TO RESOLVE DISPUTES; (ii) YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE A COURT RESOLVE MOST DISPUTES (except as set forth in this arbitration agreement); AND (except as provided in sub-parts K and L, below) YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO SERVE AS A REPRESENTATIVE, AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR IN ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, AND/OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OF CLAIMANTS, IN ANY LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST US OR A RELATED PARTY. WE ARE GIVING UP OUR RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL AND RIGHTS TO HAVE MOST DISPUTES (except as set forth in this arbitration agreement) WITH YOU RESOLVED IN A COURT.

(E) No class action or public injunctive relief in arbitration. Disputes shall be resolved by binding arbitration only on an individual basis with You. THEREFORE, THE ARBITRATOR SHALL NOT CONDUCT CLASS ARBITRATION OR ENTER INJUNCTIVE RELIEF BEYOND THAT NECESSARY TO REMEDY YOUR OWN ALLEGED INJURY OR TO PREVENT FUTURE INJURY TO YOU ALONE.

(F) Limitations of Actions. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you acknowledge and agree that any claims between you and the Company (including any of the Company Parties) arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the Services must be filed within two calendar years after such claim accrues, or forever be barred.

(G) Mandatory Informal Good Faith Dispute Resolution Before Formal Arbitration. If you and Company (including any Party or Lender (including any successor or assignee)) have a Dispute and our customer service team is unable to resolve your concern, you and Company (including any Company Party or Lender (or successor or assignee)) agree to make a good faith effort to resolve it informally prior to initiating a formal arbitration proceeding. Such informal dispute resolution shall take place on an individual basis only. If you intend to initiate an arbitration proceeding, you must first send a verified notice to us that describes the Dispute. The Notice must include your name and contact information (address, telephone number, and email address), sufficient information to enable us to identify any transaction at issue; and a detailed description of (1) the Dispute, (2) the nature and



---


basis of your claims, and (3) the nature and basis of the relief sought, with a detailed calculation. The Notice shall be sent by email to: legal@aven.com and support@aven.com. If requested by us, you must personally and solely on an individual basis appear at and participate in a telephone settlement conference (if you are represented by counsel, your counsel may also participate) to discuss the Dispute. If the Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Notice (which period can be extended by agreement of the parties), you or we may commence a formal dispute resolution proceeding by following the guidance set forth in the next sub-paragraph, sub-paragraph H. Compliance with and completing this informal dispute resolution process is a condition precedent to filing any formal dispute resolution proceeding, including a demand for arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in this informal dispute resolution process.

# (H) Arbitration administrator, election to arbitrate and other arbitration procedures.

If you and we are unable to resolve the Dispute through the mandatory informal dispute resolution process, you and we agree that any party to a Dispute, including any Company Party, may elect to arbitrate a Dispute. An arbitration may also be demanded by any Party after a claim or counterclaim is filed in court. If one party starts or threatens a lawsuit, the other party can demand arbitration. This demand can be made in court papers. It can be made if a party starts a lawsuit on an individual basis and then tries to pursue a class action or public injunctive relief. Either you, we or a Company Party may seek to stay a lawsuit or enforce arbitration as provided for by law if either you or we fail to abide by the terms of this Arbitration Agreement including the requirement to pursue Mandatory Good Faith Informal Dispute Resolution before starting a formal arbitration.

A party, Company Party or Lender demands arbitration by sending the other party or parties written notice by certified mail return receipt requested of their intent to arbitrate (hereafter “demand”) setting forth the subject of the dispute along with the relief requested. The demand should be sent to 548 Market Street, San Francisco, CA 94104, legal@aven.com, and support@aven.com with a copy sent by mail, return receipt requested, to the arbitration administrator. The arbitration shall be administered by either the American Arbitration Association (1-800-778-7879) http://www.adr.org or JAMS (1-800-352-5267) http://www.jamsadr.com. The party (including a Company Party or Lender) receiving a demand shall respond in writing by certified mail return receipt requested within twenty (20) days. Regardless of who first demands arbitration, You may select between AAA or JAMS as the administrator. If You are the first person to demand arbitration, you must inform the Company, the Company Party or the Lender of your selection of AAA or JAMS with your demand. If the Company, a Company Party, or a Lender is the first to demand arbitration, you must notify us within twenty (20) days in writing by certified mail return receipt requested of your selection. If you fail to timely notify us or a Company Party of your selection, then we have the right to select between AAA or JAMS.

The parties to such Dispute will be governed by the rules and procedures of the selected arbitration administrator applicable to consumer disputes, to the extent those rules and procedures do not contradict the express terms of this Arbitration Agreement, including the requirement of Informal Good Faith Dispute Resolution and the limitations on the arbitrator set forth below. You understand that You may obtain a copy of the rules and procedures by contacting the arbitration organization listed above. If there is any reason that an arbitrator or arbitration administrator cannot be selected under this Arbitration Agreement, You agree that one will be selected by a court, or by agreement of the parties, and the AAA rules in effect at the time this Arbitration Agreement is accepted by you will govern the resulting arbitration (to the extent not inconsistent with this Arbitration Agreement) unless the parties otherwise agree. However, neither the court nor any party may select an arbitration administrator if that administrator's arbitration rules would permit class relief contrary to this Arbitration Agreement. Similarly, if the AAA or JAMS rules are changed to allow class arbitration contrary to this Paragraph, then they are disqualified from serving as the arbitration administrator.

# (I) Selection of the arbitrator and law to be applied in arbitration.

The arbitrator shall be selected in accordance with the applicable rules of the arbitration administrator provided, however, that the arbitrator shall be a retired judge and, for matters in which the amount in controversy exceeds $100,000, the arbitrator shall have served at least 10 years as a judge. This Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sections 1 -16 (the "FAA"). The arbitrator shall follow substantive law consistent with the FAA. The arbitrator shall apply the Limitations of Actions set forth in Paragraph I(F); and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law. For purposes of this sub-paragraph "substantive law" shall exclude the Washington Uniform Arbitration Act, RCW 7.04A.010 et seq.; for avoidance of doubt, the Arbitration Agreement is governed by the FAA and not by any state law governing arbitration, consolidation or joinder of parties. Further, for purposes of this sub-paragraph, "Substantive law" means and includes federal law including federal preemption law, for issues that would be governed by the laws of the United States if they were heard in court and Washington law for issues that would be governed by state law if they were heard in court. The arbitrator, however, shall have discretion to consider and



---


apply choice of law rules in the event of a dispute regarding choice of law for issues that would be governed by state law in a court proceeding.

# (J) Payment of arbitration fees.

Regardless of whom demands arbitration, upon Your request, We or the Company Party (as the case may be) will pay your portion of the expenses associated with the arbitration, including the filing, administrative, hearing and arbitrator's fees; provided, each party shall bear their own attorney's fees and expenses, such as witness and expert witness fees. The arbitration hearing or hearings will be conducted in the county of your residence, or within 30 miles from such county, in such place as shall be ordered by the arbitrator, or as subsequently agreed in writing by the parties to the arbitration. If allowed by statute or applicable law, the arbitrator may award a party's reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. At the timely request of any party, the arbitrator shall provide a written explanation for the award or awards the arbitrator enters. The arbitrator's award may be confirmed in any court having jurisdiction over the parties. The arbitrator may decide, with or without a hearing, any motion that is substantially similar to a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim or a motion for summary judgment. The parties agree that the arbitral award shall not be entitled to preclusive effect in any other arbitration or proceeding. To the full extent permitted by law, neither will an arbitral award arising in any other proceeding be preclusive with respect to any Dispute subject to arbitration under this Agreement.

# (K) Small claims tribunal/ Exercise of Self-Help, Repossession or Foreclosure Remedies/Provisional Remedies.

We or a Company Party will not demand arbitration of any lawsuit you bring (whether complaint, crossclaim or counterclaim) as an individual action in small-claims court; however, if such compliant, cross-claim or counterclaim is not brought on an individual only basis or is transferred or removed to a different court, we or a Company Party may then exercise the right to arbitrate a Dispute or Disputes according to this Arbitration Agreement. Likewise, You and the Company agree that either party may consistent with the agreement to arbitrate seek provisional remedies pending appointment of the arbitrator or engage in the exercise of self-help remedies including repossession outside of arbitration, provided, however, that any Dispute regarding the lawfulness and alleged damages resulting from the exercise of such exercise of self-help remedies shall be decided subsequently in arbitration by the arbitrator in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement.

# (L) California Public injunctive relief.

If Your Dispute asserts a claim for public injunctive relief under California law, you agree that the arbitrator will decide, applying Washington choice of law rules, whether Washington or California law governs the claim. If the arbitrator determines that California law applies to your claim for public injunctive relief, you may bring that claim in court, but only after the arbitrator determines all other arbitrable issues and the arbitrator's award is issued and confirmed. We agree to toll the limitations period (contractual and statutory) applicable to the California public injunctive relief claim during the pendency of the arbitration and until issuance of the award. In no event shall the arbitrator issue public injunctive relief in arbitration.

# (M) Severability.

If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement cannot be enforced, the unenforceable portion will be severed and the rest of this Arbitration Agreement will continue to apply, except that: (i) if it is finally determined the class action waiver contained in this Arbitration Agreement cannot be enforced or the arbitrator (contrary to this Arbitration Agreement) purports to decide a Dispute on a class or other representative basis or issue public injunctive relief, only this sentence will apply and the remainder of this Arbitration Agreement will be void. If after exhaustion of all appellate rights, it is finally determined by a Court or arbitrator that this Arbitration Agreement is wholly unenforceable, then all Disputes shall be resolved in accordance with Section II, below.

# (N) Opt-Out.

If you do not want this Arbitration Agreement to apply to Disputes, You must send Us a signed notice within [30] calendar days after accepting this Arbitration Agreement. You must send the notice in writing to legal@aven.com and support@aven.com. You must provide your name, address and the date. You must state that you "opt out" of this Arbitration Agreement. If you do not opt out in compliance with the instructions set forth in this Paragraph, then this Arbitration Agreement will apply to Disputes. If you do opt out, Sub-Section II of this Paragraph will apply to you.

# (O) Binding effect.

This Arbitration Agreement is binding upon the parties hereto and their respective heirs, successors, assigns and applies for the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, successors and assigns. This Arbitration Agreement continues in full force and effect, even if your obligations have been paid or discharged through bankruptcy. This Arbitration Agreement survives any cancellation, termination, amendment, expiration or performance of this Arbitration Agreement or any transaction between the parties hereto or a Company Party and continues in full force and effect unless the parties hereto otherwise agree in writing.

# CREDIT CARD ACCOUNT OR OTHER FINANCIAL PRODUCT SECURED BY A MORTGAGE OR DEED OF TRUST ON YOUR PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE.

If this Section II applies to you, then:

# (A) Meaning of Dispute and Governing law.

The term "Dispute" or "Disputes" shall have the meaning set forth in the section entitled Governing Law. The Governing Law section shall apply to Disputes governed by this Section II. However, with respect to an issue governed by state law, if the law of the forum state precludes application of Washington law in whole or in part, then the state law selected in accordance with the choice of law rules of the forum state shall govern any state law issues to which Washington law cannot apply and Washington law shall govern the remaining state law issues in dispute. Further, to the extent the Dispute(s) arises out of or relates to, a credit agreement, a security instrument, mortgage or Deed of Trust given by you in connection with use of the Services and the applicable instrument selects a particular state law (other than Washington law) to apply to an issue of state law, that law shall apply to the issue for which it is selected and Washington law shall apply to any remaining state law issues that form part of the Dispute. For avoidance of doubt, state law shall be subordinate to or preempted by federal law as provided by the laws of the United States. Section II shall not be construed to preclude any party from engaging in the exercise of self-help remedies including repossession or to preclude the Company or any trustee, mortgagee or beneficiary (or assignee thereof) with respect to a mortgage or deed of trust from commencing and prosecuting to completion non-judicial foreclosure proceedings.

# (B) Notice of Dispute.

You and the Company mutually agree to notify the other party in accordance with this sub-paragraph of an alleged Dispute and further agree that until such notice is given and the other party is given a reasonable period after the giving of such notice to take corrective action, neither party may commence, join, or be joined to any judicial action (either as an individual litigant or a member of a class). If Applicable Law provides a time period that must elapse before certain action can be taken, that time period will be deemed to be reasonable for purposes of this sub-paragraph. Among other things, service of a Notice of Default or Acceleration given to a Borrower pursuant to an applicable mortgage or Deed of Trust and the passage of the time period set forth for such notice in the applicable instrument will be deemed to satisfy the notice and opportunity to take corrective action provisions of this sub-paragraph. Otherwise, a period of 30 days shall be deemed reasonable. The Notice shall be sent to: 548 Market Street, San Francisco, CA 94104, legal@aven.com and support@aven.com. You must personally sign the Notice. Upon the giving of Notice of a Dispute any applicable limitations period shall be tolled for 30 days or until such time a judicial action is commenced. The Company (including any Company Party or Lender) may provide notice to any telephone number, e-mail address, mailing address, or physical or electronic address you provided to the Company or the Lender, or at which you may be reached using the telephone number provided by you and/or the address provided by you in any application or any credit agreement submitted in connection with Your use of the Services. Nothing in this clause shall be construed to bar a consumer from bringing an action in an appropriate district court of the United States, or any other court of competent jurisdiction, for damages or relief in connection with any violation of federal law. Rather, this provision is meant to serve as a condition precedent in service of the conservation of the parties’ resources, and of judicial economy. Nothing in this clause shall prejudice the right of either you or the Company, any Company Party, or the Lender to obtain provisional relief or other equitable remedies to maintain the status quo pending conclusion of the reasonable period for corrective action. Nor shall this clause be construed to preclude any party from engaging in the exercise of self-help remedies including repossession or to preclude any trustee, mortgagee or beneficiary (or successor or assignee thereof) with respect to a Mortgage or Deed of Trust arising out of or related to Your use of the Services from commencing and prosecuting to completion non-judicial foreclosure proceedings.

# (C) Jury Trial Waiver.

You and Company (including as applicable any of the Company Parties) knowingly and voluntarily waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any and all rights to trial by jury of any Disputes between you and the Company (including of the Company Parties) arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the Services.

# (D) Limitation of Actions.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, you acknowledge and agree that any action with respect to Disputes between you and the Company (including any of the Company Parties) arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the Services must be filed within two calendar years after such claim accrues, or forever be barred.

# (E) Judicial Reference Proceeding - California Residents Only.



---



# California Residents

This subsection E applies to you if: (i) you are a California resident at the time any Claim is asserted; or (ii) you were a California resident at the time you agreed to these Terms.

If this California specific provision applies to you, you and Company (including any Company Parties or Lender) agree that all Disputes (save for those for which only federal courts have jurisdiction) between you and the Company (including any of the Company Parties) shall be resolved pursuant to the provisions for general reference and trial by referee (sitting without jury) set forth in California Code of Civil procedure Section 638(a), as expressly modified by the provisions hereof (a “Reference Action”). You and Company (including any Company Parties or Lender) agree and acknowledge that in a reference action, any Dispute will be heard by a Referee and not by a jury and hereby waive their respective constitutional and statutory rights to have a trial in front of a jury.

The referee (“Referee”) shall be an active member of the California bar. The Referee shall be appointed who is either (i) agreed to by the parties within (30) days of notice by any party to the other of the intention to invoke this judicial reference agreement, or (ii) failing such agreement, then one will be appointed by Superior Court in and for the County of San Mateo (the “Court”). The Parties agree that any Party may (and, if necessary, the other Party shall join in such filing) file with the Clerk of the Court, and/or with the appropriate judge of such Court, any and all petitions, motions, applications or other documents necessary to obtain the appointment of such a Referee. The Parties agree that venue is proper in San Mateo County, consent to personal jurisdiction and venue in that County for all claims governed by this provision and for any issues related to the enforcement of this judicial reference agreement and that all such claims shall be heard by the Court or referee (as the case may be) in San Mateo County unless the parties otherwise agree in writing. Upon request, the Company (or as applicable, any Company Party or Lender) will pay your portion of the fees and expenses of the Referee. The Referee shall be appointed for all purposes and may hear and determine all issues of fact and law and conduct all such proceedings and make any other orders or rulings a sitting judge of the Superior Court in and for the County of San Mateo would be empowered to make in any action or proceeding in the Superior Court, including any and all proceedings with respect to representative or class actions, and post-trial proceedings.

The Referee shall apply the Governing Law and Limitations of Action clauses set forth in sub-paragraph II (A) of the Dispute Resolution Terms to the fullest extent permitted by law. The parties intend this general reference agreement to be specifically enforceable in accordance with the California Code of Civil Procedure. The decisions of the Referee shall be appealable (or subject to writ review) to the same extent and in the same manner that such decision would be appealable if rendered by a judge of a Superior Court. The Referee shall in his/her statement of decision set forth his/her findings of fact and conclusions of law. Nothing in this judicial reference clause shall prejudice the right of either you or Company (or any of the Company Parties) to obtain provisional relief or other equitable remedies in the Superior Court of San Mateo County as shall otherwise be available judicially pending appointment of the Referee. Nor shall this judicial reference agreement or any provision thereof be construed to preclude any party from engaging in the exercise of self-help remedies including repossession or to preclude the Company or any trustee, mortgagee or beneficiary (or successor or assignee thereof) with respect to a Mortgage or Deed of Trust arising out of or related to the Services obtained by You from commencing and prosecuting to completion non-judicial foreclosure proceedings including proceedings pursuant to Cal. Civil Code, § 2924 et seq.
