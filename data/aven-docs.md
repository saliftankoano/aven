# Aven Support - Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

**Is the rate variable?**
The Aven Card is a variable rate credit card. Cash outs may have a fixed rate option. See your offer for details. The variable rate varies based on an Index (Prime Rate published in the Wall Street Journal or the Federal Funds Target Rate Upper Limit set by the Federal Reserve). This is outside Aven's control. As the Index shifts up or down, so will the APR on the Aven Card and any other variable-rate credit cards, lines, and loans. The Index may change several times a year or go for many months without change.

**How does Aven determine the credit line size and interest rate?**
Aven's bank-standard underwriting system is fully automated, and calculates offers based on an applicant's income, equity, credit, and debt obligations.

**Does Aven offer a fixed rate?**
Some Aven cardholders may be able to create fixed payment, fixed rate Simple Loan plans. Applicants can check their details in their account agreement.

**Is Aven a credit card or a home equity line of credit?**
It is both! Aven is a home equity line of credit that customers access through a credit card. Aven cardholders can use their Aven Card wherever VISA cards are accepted.

Aven cardholders can transfer cash directly from their Aven account to another bank account â€“ it is called a CashOut. There may be a one time fee (please see your account agreement) of the total amount being transferred that will be added to the balance.

To transfer balance from a high interest credit card to the Aven card, cardholders can request a balance transfer (BT) to their credit card. There may be a one time fee (please see your account agreement) of the total amount being transferred that will be added to the balance.

## Payments

**How are payments calculated for fixed installment plans?**
Aven offers fixed payment plans that amortize over several years, details being in the account agreement. The payment is calculated so that the entire amount of the plan and the interest is paid off by the end of the selected term. For payment estimates, please visit https://www.aven.com/paymentcalculator

**How do you compute my minimum due every month?**
For revolving balance plans, the minimum monthly payment is 1% of the principal plus the monthly interest rate on the outstanding balance. For fixed monthly payment plans, the monthly payment amount is the same every month. If an account has multiple plans, each plan's minimum payment is added to calculate the total minimum payment due for the entire account. For payment estimates, please visit https://aven.com/paymentCalculator.

**Is there a prepayment penalty?**
There is no prepayment penalty on an Aven Card account. Cardholders can pay more than the minimum due each month, make extra lump-sum payments, or make a full payoff payment. Cardholders can also find more details about their Account Agreement at https://my.aven.com/card/accountDetails

**Important Note:** If a Cardholder intends to payoff an account, the funds must be sent through wire transfer. If any other method of funding is used, there will be a 60 day wait period before the lien is released. Aven is unable to waive or shorten this wait period.

**How is interest calculated on the Aven account?**
Interest calculation on the Aven card depends on the type of balance (purchase, balance transfer, cash out, fixed payment plan balance, etc) on an account. Most accounts have several balance types, so the total interest is the sum of the interest calculated on each balance type.

- For purchases, interest accrues daily at the daily interest rate (APR divided by 365). This interest is waived for new purchases if the entire purchase balance is paid in full by the due date shown on the next statement. If the purchase balance is not paid in full, in the next cycle, there will be interest for 2 cycles on the purchase, starting from the date of the purchase.
- For Balance Transfers and Cash-outs that are revolving plans, interest accrues daily at the daily interest rate (APR divided by 365), starting when the Cash-Out or Balance Transfer is disbursed.
- Any balances in a fixed monthly payment plan either have interest accrued daily at the daily interest rate of the plan (Plan APR divided by 365) or have a fixed monthly fee in place of interest. These charges are disclosed at the time of plan creation.

In addition to interest, the monthly payment also includes repayment of a portion of the principal balance. For Purchases, Balance Transfers, and Cash Outs on revolving plans, 1% of the outstanding balance is the principal portion of the minimum due. For fixed monthly payment plans, the part of the fixed payment that is not interest or monthly fee is allocated to the principal.

If an account has zero balance in any cycle, there will be no payment due for that cycle.

**When is the monthly payment due?**
Statements are generated each month close to the monthly anniversary of when cardholders signed up for an Aven account. Payment due dates are highlighted in the statement as well as in the Aven Card app. Statements are available on the Aven app and online: https://my.aven.com/statements

**How can I make a payment on my monthly statement?**
Aven cardholders can pay their Aven bill using the Aven Card app. Please note that Aven does not accept checks or cash by mail. https://my.aven.com/

**Do missed payments impact a customer's home?**
One or two late payments will not put a cardholders home at risk or in default. Aven offers multiple hardship services to cardholders who struggle with their payments. Please note that an account may be blocked if no payment is received by the time the next statement is issued.

**Can I pay with a check?**
Aven cardholders can use the Aven Card app to easily connect their bank account using their routing and account number to make a payment. They can also use their existing online banking platforms to make payments to Aven. https://my.aven.com/

**Can I add or remove bank accounts for Auto pay or bill pay?**
Cardholders can add or remove bank accounts in the Aven Card app or online at https://my.aven.com/card

**Does a purchase refund count against the minimum payment due?**
While a refunded purchase will reduce a customer's remaining statement balance, it will not count towards the minimum due payment - with one exception: if there is only one purchase during the cycle, and this purchase is refunded to bring the statement balance to zero, there will be no minimum payment for that cycle.

## Before You Apply

**What are the eligibility criteria for applying for Aven?**
Aven's bank-standard underwriting system is fully automated and generates an offer based on an applicant's income, equity, credit, and debt obligations. Meeting the minimum criteria does not guarantee an approval. All signers (applicants and/or co-owners) must be at least 18 years of age or older. All signers must possess valid government issued identification documents specified by Aven. For lines above $100,000, borrowers need to provide proof of insurance and proof of adding Aven/Coastal Community Bank as a beneficiary on the policy.

**How do you verify income?**
Aven can verify income by securely connecting an applicant's bank account, or reviewing uploaded documents including Form 1040, a pay stub, W2, 1099-R, 1099-SSA, 1099-B, retirement income, benefit income. Aven's online application will specify the types of documents to upload.

**Will applying affect or impact my credit score?**
When you apply for an Aven card, we perform a "soft pull" on your credit in order to determine an offer. This does NOT impact the applicant's credit score. You can check your offer without your credit score being affected.

Only after you accept an offer and schedule a time with our notaries will we make a hard inquiry on your credit profile. This may impact the credit score.

**What if I am self-employed?**
Aven accepts self-employed applicants. For further information regarding income verification, contact support.

**What is HMDA?**
Section 1003.4(a)(10) of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act requires all mortgage lenders to collect various consumer data, including information about an applicant's ethnicity, race, sex, and age. We state this requirement at the top of the page in which the information is collected. This protected information in no way impacts an applicant's offer, as required by the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Fair Housing Act. In fact, applicants have the opportunity to refuse disclosure of this information, as you did, nullifying any opportunity for discrimination.

**Can I pay off an existing HELOC with the Aven Card?**
Aven offers a HELOC refinance product for qualified applicants.

**What credit score or FICO score do you use?**
Aven uses FICO V9 and VantageScore 4.0 from Experian, a top credit reporting agency.

**Why do I have to wait the 3 business cancellation or rescission period?**
Consumer protection regulations require that applicants be given three business days to cancel the account because of the security interest in the home. You cannot use the card until the cancellation period (also known as a rescission period) has expired.

This regulation was established by the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) under U.S. federal law, and allows a borrower to cancel a home equity loan, line of credit, or refinance with a new lender, within three days of closing.

**Can I apply or be eligible if my home is in a flood hazard zone?**
Yes, Aven does support properties in flood zones. Applicants will be required to submit proof of active flood insurance during the application process. If the property is a condo, applicants may be requested to upload proof of the condo buildings flood insurance policy along with the applicant's individual Homeowner's Insurance Policy.

Once approved for an Aven Card, Cardholders are required to send a copy of the flood (and HOI for Condos) once it renews. A reminder notice will be sent 45 days and 15 days prior to the insurance expiration.

If the property is designated by FEMA into a flood zone in the future, a 45 and 15 day notice will be sent to Cardholders advising of the need to purchase and present acceptable flood insurance.

**Are you a bank or FDIC insured? Who provides the credit?**
We are partnered with Coastal Community Bank, member FDIC, pursuant to license by Visa USA Inc. You benefit from our innovation, great pricing, and simple convenience with the trust of a traditional FDIC-insured bank. The Aven Card is issued by Coastal Community Bank, pursuant to a license from Visa U.S.A., Inc. Aven accounts are made by Coastal Community Bank, Member FDIC. NMLS #462289.

**What happens if I want to refinance?**
There are generally two situations of refinancing:

1. Aven customer wants to refinance their first mortgage while keeping the Aven card open and active. In this case, Aven will work with the customer's first mortgage lender to complete a subordination agreement.
2. Aven customer wants to payoff and close the Aven account. In this case, the Aven customer needs to submit a payoff quote request from the Aven app or online. Please note that when Aven receives the payoff request, the account will be blocked from further charges. This is done to prevent the account balance increasing beyond the payoff quote.

**What happens when a house is sold?**
Your settlement agent will send Aven a payoff request. Aven will close the account and release the lien when the balance is paid in full.

**Do mortgage payments have to be current?**
Aven's underwriting system looks at mortgage payment history to determine an applicant's eligibility. The system will not accept applicants with mortgages that have been delinquent or have been in forbearance during the last 24 months.

**How long is the offer valid for?**
Applicants have 30 calendar days to accept and finish signing, after which the offer will expire. If additional information such as Income or Tax documents or Trust documents are requested, these must be provided within the same 30 day window.

**How does someone cancel their application?**
Applicants offers will expire on its own after a period of inactivity. There is no need to explicitly cancel an application.

**Can I get approved if I have had a recent bankruptcy?**
Aven's automated underwriting system looks for 12 months to have passed since a Bankruptcy discharge/dismissal, at least 24 months since the last mortgage delinquency or forbearance, and at least 48 months since foreclosure or mortgage default history.

**Can I get another HELOC if I have an Aven account?**
Aven has no control on other lenders' approval processes. If someone has an Aven account and wishes to open another HELOC they will have to communicate with the other lender.

**Will debt consolidation improve my chances for approval?**
Aven's bank-standard underwriting system is fully automated and generates an offer based on an applicant's income, equity, credit, and debt obligations. The system takes into account potential for debt consolidation in underwriting applicants. System denial decisions cannot be overturned at our end.

**Is the Aven Card Tax Deductible?**
The Aven Home card is a Home Equity Line of Credit. Aven will issue Form 1098s on all accounts where there is $0.01 or more of interest paid during the year. You will need to consult tax rules or a tax advisor to determine whether your interest payments are tax deductible.

**What is Aven reported as to the Credit Bureau?**
The Aven Card will be reported as a Home Equity Line of Credit.

## Offer, Rates & Fees

**Is there an initial draw requirement?**
Some offers do have an initial draw requirement. See your account agreement for details. For cards with lines above $100,000, if the draw in the first 90 days is less than $50,000, Aven may reduce the line size to the amount outstanding, plus $25,000.

**Which Index do you use?**
For variable rate loans, Aven uses two different Indices. Your Cardholder agreement will specify the Index used for your account.

Wall Street Journal Prime (WSJ Prime): The Wall Street Journal surveys some of the country's biggest banks and publishes a consensus rate based on the survey. This is one of the most common indices used for many lending products. Look up the latest rates on the website of the Wall Street Journal: https://www.wsj.com/market-data/bonds/moneyrates

Federal Funds Target Rate - Upper Limit (FFTR-UL): This rate is set by the Open Market Committee of the US Federal Reserve (FOMC). It is the short-term interest rate at which U.S. Banks and Credit Unions lend to each other overnight within the Federal Reserve system. Look up the latest rates on the website of the St. Louis Fed: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=QGiM

The rate on your account is the sum of the index and the margin. Both can be found in your Account Agreement.

**Do you give a HUD-1?**
There is no HUD-1 form associated with the Aven Home Card. The Account Agreement contains all the required information, notices, and disclosures.

**How do applicants get higher credit limits?**
For applicants, Aven's automated underwriting system cannot modify the credit limit or rate. Aven's bank-standard underwriting system is fully automated and generates an offer based on an applicant's income, equity, credit, and debt obligations.

**What is my monthly interest rate?**
A cardholder's monthly interest rate is their current APR, divided by 365, multiplied by the number of days in that monthly billing cycle. For fixed monthly payment plans, amount, term, and other details are presented and disclosed at the time of plan creation. Cardholders can find their current rates in the Aven App (under "Account Details"). The effective APR for each billing cycle is also printed in the statement.

**Is Aven a simple interest loan or does it have an amortization schedule?**
Aven offers several balance plans and some of them use the simple interest method of interest calculation.

For revolving balances, Aven uses the Average Daily Balance method of interest calculation. For each billing cycle, we add the interest bearing balance on each day of the cycle and divide it by the number of days in the cycle to get the Average Daily Balance for the billing cycle. We then calculate interest on this balance for the duration of the billing cycle, using the rate in effect on the last day of the billing cycle. Cardholders can find the rate used for the cycle on their statement in the "Plan Summary" section towards the end.

For fixed monthly payment plans, amount, term, and other details are presented and disclosed at the time of plan creation. (Some Aven cardholders may be able to create fixed payment fixed rate Installment plans for 5, 10, 15, or 30 years. Please check your account agreement to see if you have these plans.)

**Are there caps on rates?**
The Aven Card rate will vary based on the Index - either Prime Rate published in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) or the Federal Funds Target Rate - Upper Limit (FFTR-UL) set by the Federal Reserve. Please look at your account agreement for which the Index is used in your account. The maximum APR is 18%. The latest WSJ Prime Rate and FFTR-UL Rate can be found on the public internet at the Wall Street Journal webpage, or the Federal Reserve webpage.

**Are there any origination or annual fees?**
The Aven Card comes without application fees, annual fees, or account closing fees. Select offers for some customers might include first-draw fees, clearly indicated at the time of the offer.

**Would the effective interest rate stay the same for fixed monthly payment plans?**
The effective interest rate may vary for fixed monthly payment plans. On the day a cardholder sets up a fixed monthly payment plan, the rate is calculated as the account's current variable rate + a Fixed Rate premium (For some Aven cardholders, it may vary, see your account agreement).

Box 1 of the Form 1098 contains the total interest you paid during 2024. To be included in this Box, the interest must have been actually paid between Jan 01, 2024 and Dec 31, 2024. If you got a statement in Dec 2024 which you paid in Jan 2025, that amount will not be included in the Form 1098 for 2024.

Box 2 of the Form 1098 contains the total principal that you had on Jan 01, 2024 and any additional draws or purchases you took during the year, up through Dec 31, 2024.

Aven does not accept POAs for signatures, except for active duty personnel who are deployed overseas with a military POA.

This is not an issue. Aven's notary system can easily schedule two separate notary appointments.

**I have a joint account. What happens if only one of us loses their job while we are enrolled in Debt Protection?**
If either of the co-borrowers experiences involuntary unemployment, the account will be covered for the coverage listed above.

**What happens if I don't pay the Debt Protection fee?**
If you don't pay your Debt Protection fees, the loan addendum will be considered lapsed and you will not be eligible to file a claim in the event of involuntary unemployment.

Once a decision has been made, Securian Financial will notify you and Aven and issue a payment to Aven under the contractual liability policy. Please note that the cancellation date would be effective as of the date of unemployment.

**How are Debt Protection fees calculated?**
The monthly rate charged is $0.92 per $1,000 of balances for single accounts and $1.75 per $1,000 of balances for joint accounts.

For example, if you have $30,000 of outstanding balances at your statement date, you would see a $27.60 charge as a single account holder and a $52.50 charge as a joint account holder in the following statement. Fees are always paid for balances in arrears.

This fee will show up on your monthly statement as a separate charge. As long as you are current on paying these fees, you will be able to file a claim in the event of involuntary job loss.

**How much am I covered for with Debt Protection? Are there any limitations with Debt Protection?**
Debt Protection covers participating customers up to $50,000 in total payments and up to $1,000 in monthly payments for up to 6 months. Customers can file for multiple occurrences of involuntary job loss after a 6 month waiting period after a prior occurrence.

As an example, say a customer has $50,000 of balances outstanding at a 12% APR at the time of a qualifying job loss event. Their minimum monthly payment is $1,000 consisting of $500 in principal and $500 in accrued interest. Under the Debt Protection program, this customer would be eligible to cancel up to 6 months of minimum monthly payments and stay current on their account. This customer would also be able to file another claim in the event of a subsequent job loss event. If the customer becomes involuntarily unemployed again within 6 months of returning to full-time work, this will be a continuation of the first event. But if the customer becomes involuntarily unemployed again more than 6 months after they return to full-time work, this will be a new event. In this scenario, they would have $9,000 in eligible coverage remaining.

Please note, the $1,000 monthly limit may not be sufficient to cover your minimum monthly payment to keep you current. In this event, a customer would have to pay the difference between their minimum monthly payment and the $1,000 to stay current.

**Is Debt Protection considered an insurance product? How does Debt Protection work?**
No, Debt Protection is not an insurance protection. Anyone who elects to join will sign an addendum to their loan agreement with Aven. In the event of involuntary job loss, Aven will cancel up to six months of a borrower's monthly payments per occurrence of job loss if the claim is approved.

Aven maintains a contractual liability policy and administrative services agreement with Securian Financial. In the event of a Debt Protection claim, Securian would approve it and reimburse funds to Aven Financial.

**Who is eligible for Debt Protection?**
In order to qualify, you must:

- Be under 70 years old
- Actively work a minimum of 24 hours per week
- Not be self-employed

**What is Debt Protection?**
For a small monthly fee, you can protect yourself and your home for up to six months per occurrence of involuntary job loss. Aven makes no money from this offering - we offer it strictly for the benefit of any customers who are worried about potentially losing their home.

Please note, this product is only meant to help you manage your Aven card. Aven may still foreclose if the max monthly claim payment from debt protection is not sufficient to cover the minimum monthly payment due. Additionally, your first lien holder may still foreclose if you fall into default on mortgage payments.
