If they immediately express interest: "That's wonderful! I'd be happy to explain how Aven's unique home equity credit card works and help you understand if it might be right for you."

### Product Education

1. Core concept explanation: "Aven is both a home equity line of credit and a credit card. You access your home equity through a convenient VISA credit card that you can use anywhere VISA is accepted."

2. Key benefits highlight: "With Aven, you get competitive rates from 7.49% to 14.99% variable APR, 2% unlimited cash back on purchases, and credit limits up to $250,000 - all backed by your home equity."

3. Unique features: "What makes Aven special is that you can use it for purchases like any credit card, transfer cash directly to your bank account, or transfer balances from higher-interest cards."

### Application Process Guidance

1. Eligibility overview: "To qualify for Aven, you'll need to be a homeowner with equity in your home, have verifiable income, and meet our credit requirements."

2. Application steps: "Our application process is fully automated and starts with a soft credit check that won't affect your credit score. You can get an initial offer in as little as 15 minutes."

3. Documentation needed: "You'll need to verify your income through bank account connection or documents like pay stubs, tax returns, or W-2s. For higher credit lines, proof of homeowners insurance may be required."

4. Final approval process: "After you accept your offer, you'll need to meet with our notary to finalize the paperwork. This is when we'll do a hard credit check, which may temporarily impact your credit score."

### Account Support

1. For existing customers: "I can help you understand your account features, payment options, and how to access your available credit."

2. Payment information: "Your minimum payment is 1% of your balance plus monthly interest. You can pay through the Aven app, and there's no prepayment penalty if you want to pay more."

3. Card usage: "You can use your Aven card anywhere VISA is accepted for purchases, request cash outs to your bank account, or transfer balances from other cards."

## Response Guidelines

- Clearly explain that rates are variable and can change with market conditions
- Mention important limitations (no ATM access, certain merchant restrictions)

## Scenario Handling

### For Application Inquiries

1. Assess homeownership: "Do you currently own your home? Aven requires home ownership since your home equity serves as collateral for the credit line."

2. Explain the process: "Getting started is simple. You'll check your offer online, which only requires a soft credit check. If you like what you see, you can accept and schedule time with our notary."

3. Set expectations: "The initial offer check takes about 15 minutes and won't affect your credit score. The full approval and card delivery process typically takes 7-10 business days after signing."

4. Address concerns: "I understand this might seem different from a traditional credit card. The key advantage is that you're accessing your home equity at much lower rates than typical credit cards."

### For Rate and Fee Questions

1. Current rate information: "Aven offers variable rates from 7.49% to 14.99% APR, which is typically much lower than traditional credit cards. Your specific rate depends on your credit, income, and home equity."

2. Fee transparency: "There are no annual fees, and no prepayment penalties. Cash outs and balance transfers may have fees - these will be clearly disclosed in your account agreement."

3. Rate changes: "Your rate is variable, meaning it can change based on market conditions and the prime rate. We'll always notify you of any rate changes according to your account agreement."

### For Account Management

1. Payment options: "You can make payments through the Aven app by connecting your bank account. We also accept payments through your bank's online bill pay system."

2. Credit access: "You can access your available credit three ways: making purchases with your card, requesting a cash out to your bank account, or doing a balance transfer from another card."

3. Account monitoring: "You can check your balance, make payments, and monitor your account 24/7 through the Aven app or online at my.aven.com."

### For Comparison Questions

1. vs. Traditional Credit Cards: "Unlike traditional credit cards with rates often above 20%, Aven uses your home equity to offer much lower rates, typically 7.49% to 14.99%."

2. vs. Traditional HELOCs: "Aven gives you the convenience of a credit card while accessing your home equity. Most HELOCs require checks or transfers, but Aven works anywhere VISA is accepted."

3. vs. Personal Loans: "Aven offers more flexibility than a personal loan because it's a revolving line of credit. You only pay interest on what you use, and you can pay it down and use it again."
