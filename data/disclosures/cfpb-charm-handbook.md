## Find out how your payment can change over time

## How to use this information

When you and your mortgage lender discuss adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), you can use this information to help you understand your options. When you apply for an ARM loan, you receive a Loan Estimate. You can request and receive multiple Loan Estimates from competing lenders to find your best deal.

You may want to have your Loan Estimate handy for any loan you are considering as you work through this information. We reference sample information throughout to help you apply the information to your situation.

You can find more information about ARMs at cfpb.gov/about-arms. You'll also find other mortgage-related CFPB resources, facts, and tools to help you take control of the homebuying process.

## About the CFPB

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau regulates the offering and provision of consumer financial products and services under the federal consumer financial laws and educates and empowers consumers to make better informed financial decisions.

## How can this information help you?

This information can help you decide whether an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) is the right choice for you and to help you take control of the homebuying process.

Your lender may have already provided you with a copy of Your Home Loan Toolkit. You can also download the Toolkit from the CFPB's Buying a House guide at cfpb.gov/buy-a-house/.

**Important:** An ARM is a mortgage with an interest rate that changes, or "adjusts," throughout the loan. With an ARM, the interest rate and monthly payment may start out low. However, both the rate and the payment can increase very quickly. Consider an ARM only if you can afford increases in your monthly payment—even to the maximum amount.

## After reviewing this information:

- You'll understand how an ARM works and whether it's the right choice for you.
- You'll know how to review important documents when you apply for an ARM.
- You'll understand the risks that come with different types of ARMs.

## Is an ARM right for you?

ARMs come with the risk of higher payments in the future that you might not be able to predict. But in some situations, an ARM might make sense for you. If you are considering an ARM, be sure to understand the tradeoffs.

**Important:** Don't count on being able to refinance before your interest rate and monthly payments increase. You might not qualify for refinancing if the value of your home goes down or if something unexpected damages your financial situation, like a job loss or medical costs.

### Fixed-Rate Mortgage vs Adjustable-Rate Mortgage

**Fixed-Rate Mortgage:**

- Consider this option if you prefer predictable payments, or you plan to keep your home for a long period of time
- Interest rate is set when you take out the loan and stays the same for the entire loan term
- Principal and interest payment stays the same over the life of your loan
- You know the total you will pay in principal and interest over the life of the loan

**Adjustable-Rate Mortgage:**

- Consider this option if you are confident you can afford increases in your monthly payment—even to the maximum amount, or you plan to sell your home within a short period of time
- Interest rate is based on an index that changes and may start out lower than a fixed rate mortgage but you bear the risk of increases throughout your loan
- Initial principal and interest payment amount remains in effect for a limited period
- You can't know in advance how much total interest you will pay because your interest rate changes
- If you can't afford the increased payments, you may lose your home to foreclosure

## Learn about how ARMs work

As you decide whether to move ahead with an ARM, you should understand how they work and how your housing costs can be affected.

### Interest rate = index + margin

The interest rate on an ARM has two parts: the index and the margin.

**Index:** An index is a measure of interest rates generally that reflects trends in the overall economy. Different lenders use different indexes for their ARM programs. Common indexes include the U.S. prime rate and the Constant Maturity Treasury (CMT) rate. Talk with your lender to find out more about the index they use, which is also shown on your Loan Estimate.

**Margin:** The margin is an extra percentage that the lender adds to the index. You can shop around to different lenders to find the lowest combination of the index plus the margin. Your Loan Estimate shows the index and the margin being offered to you.

### Understanding projected payments

**Principal & Interest:** The monthly principal and interest payment on your ARM is likely to change after the initial period. Review this section to see how your payment can change based on your loan's interest rate.

**Estimated Total Monthly Payment:** Review this row to see the total minimum and maximum monthly payments. The payments include mortgage insurance, property taxes, homeowners insurance, and any additional property assessments or other escrow items.

Keep in mind that other parts of your monthly and annual housing costs can change, such as your property taxes and homeowners insurance payments.

**Consider the impact:** Talk over how your financial life could be affected if your ARM monthly payment increases. In future years, you might face money decisions like job changes, school or other education expenses, and medical needs and expenses. Because ARM adjustments are unpredictable, you might have less or more financial flexibility for other parts of your life.

### Adjustable Interest Rate (AIR) information

You should read and understand the AIR calculations before committing to an ARM. It's important to know how your interest rate changes over the life of your loan.

**Index + Margin:** Your lender is required to show you how your interest rate is calculated, which is determined by the index and margin on your loan.

**Initial Interest Rate:** This is the interest rate at the beginning of your loan. The initial interest rate changes to the index plus the margin at your first adjustment (subject to the limits on interest rate changes). Your loan servicer tells you your new payment amount seven to eight months in advance, so you can budget for it or shop for a new loan.

**Minimum/Maximum Interest Rate:** This shows how low or high your interest rate could be over the life of your loan. Generally, an ARM's interest rate is never lower than the margin.

**Change Frequency:** This indicates when the interest rate on your loan will change. Your loan servicer sends you advance notices of changes.

**Limits on Interest Rate Changes:** This shows the highest amount your interest rate can increase when there is a change.

### "Teaser" rates

Some lenders offer a "teaser," "start," or "discounted" rate that is lower than their fully indexed rate. When the teaser rate ends, your loan takes on the fully indexed rate. Don't assume that a loan with a teaser rate is a good one for you. Not everyone's budget can accommodate a higher payment.

Consider this example:

- A lender's fully indexed rate is 4.5% (the index is 2% and the margin is 2.5%).
- The loan also features a "teaser" rate of 3%.
- Even if the index doesn't change, your interest rate still increases from 3% to 4.5% when your teaser rate expires.

## Additional ARM features to understand

### Interest-only ARMs

Some ARMs allow you to pay only the interest for a certain number of years. After that period, you must pay both principal and interest, meaning your monthly payment will increase even if interest rates stay the same. Since you are not paying any principal during the interest-only period, you are not reducing the amount you owe or building equity in your home.

### Payment option ARMs

Payment option ARMs were common before 2008 when the housing crisis began, and some lenders might still offer them.

A payment option ARM means the borrower can choose from different payment options, such as:

- A traditional principal and interest payment
- An interest-only payment
- A minimum payment, which could result in negative amortization

Negative amortization happens when you are not paying enough to cover all of the interest due. Your loan balance goes up instead of down.

## Key considerations

### Questions to ask your lender

- How high can my payment go?
- How high can my interest rate go?
- How long is my initial principal and interest payment guaranteed?

### Questions to ask yourself

- Have I shopped around to compare ARMs and fixed-rate loans?
- If an ARM has a lower initial interest rate than a fixed-rate mortgage, is paying less money now worth the risk of an increase later?
- Can I afford the highest payment possible with the ARM if I can't sell the home, or refinance into a lower rate, before the increase?
