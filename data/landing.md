## Questions?

![Image 41: PCI Compliant](blob:http://localhost/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)

What is the Aven Home Card?

Aven is a credit card that lets you use your home equity to get really low rates.

![Image 42: PCI Compliant](blob:http://localhost/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)

How does it work?

Aven combines the convenience of a credit card with the savings of a home equity line of credit (HELOC). It works like any other credit card where you can make everyday purchases and earn unlimited 2% cash back.[1](https://www.aven.com/#footnote_1)

![Image 43: PCI Compliant](blob:http://localhost/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)

Do you offer a fixed rate?

For Cash Outs and Balance Transfers, you have the option of fixed monthly payments (Aven Simple Loan). Lock in your payments for 5 or 10 years. 2.5% fee per cash out applies. Available right in the app.[4](https://www.aven.com/#footnote_4)

![Image 44: PCI Compliant](blob:http://localhost/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)

What is my monthly payment?

Monthly payments work like a standard credit card. It is calculated as 1% of the principal balance, plus monthly interest, plus any fees. [See Payment Calculator](https://www.aven.com/PaymentCalculator).

![Image 45: PCI Compliant](blob:http://localhost/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)

Can I get cash too?

Yes! You can directly deposit cash from your Aven card to your bank account at the same low rate. A 2.5% transfer fee applies.[1](https://www.aven.com/#footnote_1)

![Image 46: PCI Compliant](blob:http://localhost/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)

Does this affect my credit score?

Checking your offer does not affect your credit score. Only once you schedule with our notary to finalize will we do a hard credit check.

![Image 47: PCI Compliant](blob:http://localhost/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)

Are there any fees?

We try to reduce as many of the fees as possible. No annual, sign-up, or pre-payment fees. There is a 2.5% fee on Cash Outs and Balance Transfers and a $29 late fee if you don’t make the minimum payment.[1](https://www.aven.com/#footnote_1)

![Image 48: PCI Compliant](blob:http://localhost/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)

Why is the rate variable?

Similar to other credit cards, the rate is variable. It will vary based on the FFTR-UL as published in the Wall Street Journal, outside Aven's control. As the FFTR-UL shifts up or down, so will the APR on the Aven Card and any other variable-rate credit cards, lines, loans. The FFTR-UL may change several times a year.[1](https://www.aven.com/#footnote_1) For Cash Outs and Balance Transfers we offer fixed monthly payments (Aven Simple Loan). Lock in your monthly payment for 5 or 10 years.[4](https://www.aven.com/#footnote_4)

![Image 49: PCI Compliant](blob:http://localhost/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)

Why not get a traditional home equity line of credit instead?

Home equity lines of credit often come with high fees (usually over $1000), minimum advances, minimum credit limits (often at least $50,000), and take 4-6 weeks to close.[3](https://www.aven.com/#footnote_3) With Aven, you can get your card in just a few days in the mail, you can use it any number of times for any amount under your limit, with no origination or annual fees. Best of all, you get cash back on your purchases.[1](https://www.aven.com/#footnote_1)

![Image 50: PCI Compliant](blob:http://localhost/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)

What are the criteria to qualify for this credit card?

1. Own and have equity in your home. 2) Have an income that can support your monthly bill – we don’t want you to get into debt that you can’t afford. 3) Meet certain credit criteria, including credit score, income, and property value requirements.

1.  The annual percentage rate (“APR”) is the cost of credit as a yearly rate and does not include costs other than interest. The APR is a variable rate based on the Federal Funds Target Rate - Upper Limit (the “FFTR-UL”) index (“Index”). The FFTR-UL is determined by the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee and published periodically by the Wall Street Journal in its Money Rates section. The FFTR-UL as of Jan 10th, 2025 EST is 4.50%. Your initial APR is based on a margin, determined by your creditworthiness when you open your account, plus the Index at the time of application. Your APR is subject to change as allowed by applicable law. Best rates available only to the highest-qualified borrowers. The maximum APR will not exceed 18% during the life of your account. Cash Out (draw to bank account) fee and Balance Transfer fee is 2.5% of amount transferred. This fee is subject to change. The county where your property is located may charge recording fees. If your line is greater than $25,000, you are responsible for paying these costs. These costs will be placed in a 12-month interest free, fixed term loan and be part of your Minimum Payment Due.

You are not required to sign up for AutoPay. To receive a 0.25 percentage point discount to your APR, you must enroll in AutoPay by the end of your first billing cycle and maintain AutoPay. This discount is available to new cardholders only. If you fail to enroll, or if you discontinue AutoPay, your APR will increase by 0.25 percentage points. We reserve the right to terminate or modify the AutoPay discount program at any time without notice. See [AutoPay Terms & Conditions](https://www.aven.com/docs/AutoPayAgreement.pdf) for details.

Cash back available for those who sign up for AutoPay. See [Cash Back Terms & Conditions](https://www.aven.com/public/docs/CashbackTerms/post2024OctPrimeV3With25bps) for details. Some restrictions apply.

For the initial cash out draw, you are charged a fee of 0% of the amount drawn. This fee is subject to change. There are no fees for subsequent cash outs or balance transfers. The APR for an Aven Simple Loan (the “ASL APR”) is based on your variable APR and other factors at the time you agree to the plan. The ASL APR is fixed and will not change during the term of this plan and is subject to the applicable draw supplement.

If you have an active HELOC agreement or offer within the last 30 days that demonstrates a lower cost than ours, we’ll beat the offer or send you $250. Introductory, temporary, and promotional offers do not apply toward our guarantee. Only valid for new customers who received this specific offer. We reserve the right to change the terms of the guarantee at any time. [Guarantee Terms and Conditions](https://www.aven.com/public/docs/HelocGuaranteedLowestCost/post2024OctPrimeV3With25bps).

If you have an existing second lien (“Second Lien”) on your subject property, you acknowledge and agree that we may transfer your application to our refinance product (subject in all cases to credit approval). The refinance product may have different terms and conditions than the initial product you applied for. Please review the Early HELOC Disclosure for more information.

2.  Our APR is 7.49-14.99% for primary residences. The average for other cards in the US for people with good credit is over 24% APR. Source: "Average Credit Card Interest Rates" [wallethub.com](https://wallethub.com/edu/cc/average-credit-card-interest-rate/50841) on Jan 15, 2024 showing the average rate for credit cards in the US for people with good credit is 24.10% APR.

These comparison charts use the midpoint of each card's APR range. Aven’s midpoint as of Jul 18, 2025 is 11.24%.

4.  Our fixed monthly payment option (Aven Simple Loan) is available based on your Var APR plus fees not exceeding the High Cost Mortgage threshold set by law. Your rate will not increase while the Aven Simple Loan plan is open.

5.  Amount of 'Interest Saved' is calculated as follows:

For revolving plans – (1) for each month, we determine interest savings by multiplying (a) our current revolving balances by (b) our balance-weighted average APR minus the average interest rate on credit card plans and (c) then dividing by 12; (2) we then sum up the interest savings over all months since the company’s launch. The source of the average interest rate on credit card plans comes from [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TERMCBCCALLNS).

For fixed rate plans – (1) for each month, we determine the interest savings by multiplying (a) our current fixed rate balances by (b) our balance-weighted average APR minus the average interest rate for 5 year fixed personal loans and (c) then dividing by 12; (2) we then sum up the interest savings over all months since the company’s launch. The source of the average interest rate on personal loans comes from [Credible](https://www.credible.com/personal-loan/personal-loan-interest-rates)

We then sum up the cumulative savings for both revolving and fixed rate plans.

If you have an existing second lien (“Second Lien”) on your subject property, you acknowledge and agree that we may transfer your application to our refinance product (subject in all cases to credit approval). The refinance product may have different terms and conditions than the initial product you applied for.
